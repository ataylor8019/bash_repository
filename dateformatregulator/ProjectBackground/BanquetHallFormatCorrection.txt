I am the owner of a banquet hall, and I have a large amount of records that have become unwieldy to manage and impossible to recognize.

Problem description:

My banquet hall hosts guests for various occasions, at irregular times of the month. When hosting an event, I have my staff create an attendance list, and store the list in a folder named eventAttendance on a laptop specifically designated for that purpose. After three years, there are around 1000 lists in the folder, recording the attendance at various events.

This is the core of the problem: I am thinking of moving these lists into a database in the near future. Right now, I would like to be able to access a given date or series of dates in a file more quickly. Unfortunately, the many members of my staff have a number of ways of naming the attendance list files. They are as follows (using the first day of the year 2020 as an example):

January-1-2020
January-01-2020
January_1_2020
January_01_2020
Jan-1-2020
Jan-01-2020
Jan_1_2020
Jan_01_2020
01-01-2020
01_01_2020
01.01.2020
01012020

Additionally, the files are prefixed with the following:
attendancelist
attendance
list


As you can see, a thousand or so files, split among all of these naming formats, are impossible to scan quickly. They also present a problem for shell scripts and batch files looking to load a consistent collection of files into a database .

I require you to write an application that converts all of the above formats into the following:

attendancelog_01_01_2020

Where the first two digits are the month, the second two digits are the day of the month, and the last four digits are the year..

Additionally, this application should be able to display to the user all of the files for a given month or year, regardless of what format the file is in; it should also be able to convert the files to a number of pre-made formats of my choosing. These include:

January 01, 2020
January012020
Jan 01, 2020
Jan012020
01-01-2020
01.01.2020
01012020
01_01_2020
